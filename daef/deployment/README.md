# Overview

The current solution is currently being updated to use AKS Edge Essentials(AKSEE) and Edge for Kubernetes (E4K).
 For guidance on how to deploy the AKSEE Core Infrastructure, please refer to the instructions provided in the [Deploy AKSEE Core Infra](../docs/deployment/README.DeployAKSEE.md) guidance. E4K deployment is not available yet.

If you need to reference the previous solution that uses a cloud AKS cluster, you can still access the repo and instructions in the [Azure-Samples/distributed-az-edge-framework](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/distributed-az-edge-framework/blob/main/deployment/deploy-dev.md) guidance. Be aware that this repository may change anytime without previous notification.
